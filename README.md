# landing-page
A landing page project to practice flexbox!
- The Odin Project: [Lesson link](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)
- I am proud of myself for completing my first flex page! It looks pretty good if I do say so myself

Learning outcomes
- It was challenging to balance html element depth with convenience
  - 1. I wanted to keep minimal html elements to keep the html content easy to read/refactor
  - 2. Adding more divs made positioning elements much easier. Although soon found out this results in a lot of mental overhead very quickly trying to understand which boxes are where and how to position them
- I was confused on best practices for grouping CSS attributes/selectors and when to add classes to reduce repeated CSS attribute code. I would like to improve on this.
  - I did play around with this using the section-padding class but I would like to experiment more with this in the future!
  - In the end, less lines of CSS styling == easier to understand when I come back to this project
